This is the frontend test for nimbl3

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


Requirements
 
Convert provided design (see Resources section) into semantic HTML markup, CSS and JS.
The application should be responsive following these breakpoints:
 
Phone / Phablet (< 768px)
Tablet (> 768px and < 1024px)
Desktop (> 1024px)
 
Technical requirements:
 
HTML 5
SASS
Grunt / Gulp / Webpack
Vanilla JS /  jQuery. React / Ember JS / Vue JS favored.
ES5 / ES6 favored
 
Target browsers:
 
Chrome * / Chrome mobile (iOS/Android) *
Firefox * / Firefox mobile (iOS/Android) *
Safari / Safari mobile
IE10 / Edge and above
 
(* latest 2 versions)
 
Notes:
 
Do implement any functionality that requires a backend implementation. The rendered page should only respond to user interactions such as hover / focus but all click actions should not trigger any functionality e.g. edit quantity, edit owner...
While the artwork shows a navigation with lots of links, implement only the page that is represented in the artwork (i.e. “Orders”)
  
Methodology
 
Usage of a CSS framework is encouraged e.g. Bootstrap, Foundation, Neat
Use flexbox to build the CSS layout
Make usage of advanced SASS mixins and functions (if..else, for loops)
Icons / images should be managed vis a single sprite image
Animation of certain elements is required (see below in Exported Assets section) 
Commit all your code to Github or Bitbucket. Make regular commits and merge code using pull requests.
Optional: deploy the finished page to a PAAS provider e.g. Github Pages, AWS S3, Heroku, Zeit
